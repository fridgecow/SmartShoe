# SmartShoe
A shoe that can take you home.

This is the code for my EPQ, a wearable with BLE, accelerometer, magnetometer, and LED outputs.

Once connected to a phone or computer, the shoe can use GPS data to 'take you home'.

Interaction with the shoe is done by heelclicks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ6VT7ciR1o . "There's no place like home" is optional.

The shoe outputs information via four NeoPixels on the toe.
