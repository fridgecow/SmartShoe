Based on the Adafruit Bluefruit LE Connect App.

<ul>
    <li>Turn your shoe on and open the app</li>
    <li>Once the app finds your shoe, click connect.</li>
    <li>Done! Location, Time, and Notifications are automatically streamed to the shoe.</li>
    <li>You can give the shoe a new destination in the destination picker.</li>
</ul>

This is an app for my EPQ, a smart shoe that can take you home.
